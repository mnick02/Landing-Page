This project aims to test skills in html, css and flexbox. At the end of this project I will have demonstrated proficency in all those skills by creating a well put together mock landing page. 

Having now completed the project, a aspect that stood out to me is how flexbox is incredibly useful, but not always the end solution. For example, centering text can just be solved by the text-align and you don't have to go through all the flexbox motions to accomplish this. I also realized the importance of containers, and how separating different parts of a page into them makes certain tasks much more simple
